Looking up information for summoner : summoner_name

This shitter is SILVER II in RANKED_SOLO_5x5

This shitter is SILVER V in RANKED_FLEX_SR


## Todo
-   Make it work regardless of queue's ranked in. (right now only works if you are ranked in soloq and flex q, but not one or the other, or three's.)
- Make a function and additional argument to pivot to live game and pull in all of those players ranked information.
